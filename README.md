# EV_Vehicle_Charge_Demand

1. Project Title

# EV Demand Prediction using Machine Learning


2. Project Description

This project predicts the demand for electric vehicles (EVs) using machine learning models based on historical data, population, fuel prices, and EV registrations.


3. Problem Statement

The goal is to analyze factors influencing EV demand and build a predictive model to assist in planning and policy-making for electric vehicle adoption.


4. Technologies Used

Python

Pandas

NumPy

Matplotlib / Seaborn (for visualization)

Scikit-learn

5. Dataset
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sahirmaharajj/electric-vehicle-population-size-2024/data

Dataset includes features like year, population, petrol price, diesel price, EV registration count, etc.


6. Steps Performed

Data Cleaning

Handling Missing Values

Outlier Detection

Feature Selection

Model Building (e.g., Linear Regression)

Evaluation (MAE, MSE, RÂ² score)



7. How to Run

Install requirements (if any).

Open the notebook or Python file.

Run all cells to see the analysis and prediction.



8. Improvisation Done

- Performed outlier removal for better model accuracy.
- Tried different features and compared model performances.
- Improved data visualizations for better insights.
